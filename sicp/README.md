Solutions to SICP
================

An incomplete collection of solutions to exercises in \<Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs\>, produced during my process in learning the book. Book-site: https://mitpress.mit.edu/sicp/

Some early exercises in the Chapter One are stored
collectively in a .md, but the later ones will be seperated in single files,
either a .md or a .scm .
