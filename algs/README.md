# Solutions to *Algorithms*

C++ solutions to some exercises, and implementation of algorithms listed in the book *Algorithms*, 4th Edition, in C++.

## Notes

This implementation use std::vector in C++ STL as the default data structure to store raw input data. The two alternatives, std::array and C array, are either too cumbersome or impossible to mimic the functionality of Java Array used in the book.

## Algorithm List

1. Selection sort (include/sort.h)
2. Insertion sort (include/sort.h)
3. Shellsort (include/sort.h) 
## Todos

- more solutions
- more algorithms
- better interface
