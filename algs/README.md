# Solutions to *Algorithms*

C++ solutions to some exercises, and implementation of algorithms listed in the book *Algorithms*, 4th Edition, in C++.

## Notes

- Basic data type: This implementation use std::vector in C++ STL as the default data structure to store raw input data. The two alternatives, std::array and C array, are either too cumbersome or impossible to mimic the functionality of Java Array used in the book.
- Programming model: The utility library (stdio.hpp, stdrandom.hpp, etc.) is subtly different from those provided by the book. Check the book author's packages here: https://github.com/kevin-wayne/algs4.
