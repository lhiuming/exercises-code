# Solutions to *Algorithms*

C++ solutions to some exercises, and implementation of algorithms listed in the book *Algorithms*, 4th Edition, in C++.

## Notes

- Basic data type: This implementation use std::vector in C++ STL as the default data structure to store raw input data. The two alternatives, std::array and C array, are either too cumbersome or impossible to mimic the functionality of Java Array used in the book.
- Programming model: The utility library (stdio.hpp, stdrandom.hpp, etc.) is subtly different from those provided by the book. Check the book author's packages here: https://github.com/kevin-wayne/algs4.

## Basic Algorithms and Data Structure

1. Selection sort (include/sort.h)
2. Insertion sort (include/sort.h)
3. Shellsort (include/sort.h)
4. Top-down mergesort (todo)
5. Bottom-up mergesort (todo)
6. Quicksort (todo)
7. Quicksort with 3-way partitioning (todo)
8. Heapsort (todo)
    - MaxPQ class (todo)

9. Sequential Search Tree class (todo)
11. Binary Search Tree class (todo)
12. Red-black Binary Search Tree class (todo)
    - @NOTE: Implement a complete RBBST if schedule allows. 

## Addition Algorithms

- Quick-select (todo; page 346)

## Todos

- Finish implementing all algorithms.
- Review the skipped (and possibly interesting) exercises.
